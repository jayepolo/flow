# Flow

Flow is a simple app to manage spending against a budget.  

The intent is to keep things simpler than existing software on the market.  

The main functions are: 
* define budget categories and spend targets
* define user managed categorization rules
* import and categorize data from CSV files
* show where you stand relative to planned spend
